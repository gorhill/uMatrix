Definitely for advanced users.

***

**NOTE**: For the time being, the issue tracker has been closed due to too many users filing invalid issues due to uMatrix blocking stuff according to its ruleset (aka **doing its job**). I did warn that uMatrix is for advanced users, and advanced users are expected to be able to understand rulset and figure what needs to be done in order to unbreak stuff. I would re-open the issue tracker if I could find a way to allow only select contributors who have a good track history of filing actual valid issues, but this is currently not possible on GitHub.

**UPDATE:** There is no hope. Here is what happens when I am silly enough to think that maybe things will get better:

## Warnings

#### Regarding broken sites

uMatrix does not guarantee that sites will work fine: it is for advanced users who can figure how to un-break sites, because essentially uMatrix is a firewall which works in relaxed block-all/allow-exceptionally mode out of the box: it is not unexpected that sites will break.

**So this means do not file issues to report broken sites when the sites are broken because uMatrix does its job as expected.** I will close any such issue without further comment.

I expect there will be community driven efforts for users to help each others. If uMatrix had a home, I would probably set up a forum, but I do not plan for such thing, I really just want to code, not manage web sites. If you need help to un-break a site when using uMatrix, you can try [Wilders Security](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/umatrix-the-http-switchboard-successor.369601/), where you are likely to receive help if needed, whether by me or other users.

uMatrix can be set to work in [allow-all/block-exceptionally](https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views#the-allow-allblock-exceptionally-approach) mode with a single click on the `all` cell in the global scope `*`, if you prefer to work this way. This will of course break less sites, but you would then lose all the benefits which comes with block-all/allow-exceptionally mode -- though you will still benefit from the 62,000+ blacklisted hostnames by default.
