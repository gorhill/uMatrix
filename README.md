## Warnings

#### Regarding broken sites

uMatrix does not guarantee that sites will work fine: it is for advanced users who can figure how to un-break sites, because essentially uMatrix is a firewall which works in relaxed block-all/allow-exceptionally mode out of the box: it is not unexpected that sites will break.

**So this means do not file issues to report broken sites when the sites are broken because uMatrix does its job as expected.** I will close any such issue without further comment.

**Using uMatrix logger is key to un-break sites:** the logger will show you all that uMatrix does internally.

I expect there will be community driven efforts for users to help each others. If uMatrix had a home, I would probably set up a forum, but I do not plan for such thing, I really just want to code, not manage web sites. If you need help to un-break a site when using uMatrix, you can try [Wilders Security](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/umatrix-the-http-switchboard-successor.369601/), where you are likely to receive help if needed, whether by me or other users.

uMatrix can be set to work in [allow-all/block-exceptionally](https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views#the-allow-allblock-exceptionally-approach) mode with a single click on the `all` cell in the global scope `*`, if you prefer to work this way. This will of course break less sites, but you would then lose all the benefits which comes with block-all/allow-exceptionally mode -- though you will still benefit from the 62,000+ blacklisted hostnames by default.
