µMatrix: 一个靠点击工作的矩阵防火墙，拥有许多隐私保护工具 面向高级用户

µMatrix让你控制你的浏览器可以连接哪里，可以请求哪些数据并控制何时执行 没有人替你做决定：一切由你选择 你可以完全控制你的个人隐私

Out of the box, µMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be "broken". With two clicks, µMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.

Regarding the myth that "Chromium-based browsers can't reliably block javascript", see: https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/Blocking-javascript-execution-reliably-in-Chromium-based-browsers. Summary: Yes, javascript can be blocked reliably in Chromium.

* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).

* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).

* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, javascript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.

* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.

* Ease of use: µMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:

- domain names (left column)
  * from very specific
  * to very generic

-请求种类（顶栏）
  * cookies
  * CSS相关资源（样式表和字体）
  *图片
  *插件
  *脚本
  *XHR（由脚本发起的请求）
  * frames
  *其他

You can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.

µMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.

All rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.

The goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.

The extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 58,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).

Ultimately, you can choose however you browse the net:

* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).

* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.

Either way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.

Your choice.

You are very welcomed to contribute your views on open issues and suggestions, various arguments for/against help me in deciding what is needed to improve the extension.

Ease of use is the primary goal. I've seen users give up on Firefox's NoScript because it gets too much in the way according to them, so rather than blame these users for poor security habits, I prefer to blame developers and this project is a tentative to address the issues which cause some users to give up on basic security.

This extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.

The number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.

Simply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.

Red square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:
* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.
* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.

Green square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:
* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.
* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.

The top-left cell in the matrix, the "all" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. 我的个人倾向当然与此相反，拦截一切和放行例外

这个扩展也可用来加快上网速度，例如通过全局阻止图片
